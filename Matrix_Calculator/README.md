# Matrix_Calculator
Matrix_Calculator is a software made by Leon Jayakusuma with the purpose to help with everyday arithmetic calculations and also matrix calculations. This software is made with Python using Tkinter, Numpy and Scipy.
# Known Bugs
For matrix binary operations, changing dimensions might break the interface, so currently the binary operations only works when both matrices are 3 x 3.
# Features
## 1. Basic Numeric Operations
### 1.1. Number Input(0-9, e, pi)
### 1.2 Arithmetic Operations
1. +(addition)
2. -(subtraction)
3. x(multiplication)
4. /(division)
5. mod(modulo / division remainder)
5. square
6. factorial
7. square root, etc. 
### 1.3. Other (Clear Entry, Delete)
## 2. Unary Matrix Operations
Matrix operations that only requires 1 matrix as input such as
1. Determinant
2. Eigenvalues
3. Inverse
4. Nullspace
5. Rank
6. Trace
7. Transpose.
## 3. Binary Matrix Operations
Matrix operations that requires 2 matrices as input such as 
1. Cross Product
2. Dot Product
3. Matrix Addition
4. Matrix Subtraction
5. Matrix Multiplication
6. Inner Product
7. Outer Product
8. Scalar Multiplication
9. Solve for System of Linear Equations
